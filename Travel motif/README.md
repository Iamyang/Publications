A kind reminder is that motif detection codes here were adapted from the code of another article ([Schneider, C. M. et al. (2013) ‘Unravelling daily human mobility motifs’, Journal of The Royal Society Interface, 10(84), pp. 20130246–20130246. doi: 10.1098/rsif.2013.0246.](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsif.2013.0246)).  Schneider, C. M. et al. (2013)  gave a detailed description on their codes [here](https://github.com/humnetlab/mobilityMotifs/).
